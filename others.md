## About Philosophy
My favourite philosopher is Wittgenstein. His book *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* is really worth reading! In the book, he says 
> - 1.1: The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
> - 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.
> - 2.01: A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combibnation of objects (things).


So what's the difference between facts and things? A fact does not only consist of many objects (things) but also their complicated relations. This philosophy is really like that of category theory where we think morphisms between objects are more important than onjects themselves. It seems the world is a very complicated category. But note that this book was completed in 1918 much earlier than the work of Eilenberg and Mac Lane.
