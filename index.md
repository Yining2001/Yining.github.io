## Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Yining Chen currently a M1 student of mathematics in Toulouse. You can also find some information in my [Zhihu page](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ruo-ru-12-16) (a Chinese cummunity) where I write some posts about mathematics. But note that it's in Chinese.

## Education

* Spet. 2019 -- June 2023: B.Sc in the class of Loo-Keng Hua of Shandong University
* Spet. 2022 -- June 2023: M1 in Universit√© Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier
* I will start my master study in University of Bonn this winter 2023.

## Interests
My interests lie in interations between homotopy theory and algebraic geometry especially derived algebraic geometry. Recently I plan to study shifted symplectic and Poisson structures on derived stacks. It's known that the moduli scheme of stable coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold is -1-shifted symplectic, so I'm also interested in categorical invariants carried by the (derived) moduli stack classifying some certain sheaves on a Calabi-Yau fold.
