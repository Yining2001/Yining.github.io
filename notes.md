### Homotopical Algebra and Derived Categories
2022-05, a student project in Shandong University

This notes is about homotopy theory of topological spaces and the localization of categories. We develop such a homotopy theory using techniques similar to simplicial sets. As for localization, we introducetwo methods to construct the localization category. One is the model category developed first by Quillen and the other is the calculus of fractions which is in fact earlier than model categories. And we mainly focus on the example of chain complexes.
