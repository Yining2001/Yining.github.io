### The Geometry of Triangles
2022-05

In this article we make the concept of a continuous family of triangles precise and prove the moduli functor classifying oriented triangles admits a fine moduli space but the functor classifying non-oriented triangles only admits a coarse moduli space. We hope moduli spaces of triangles can help understand stacks. [Download notes here]

### Homotopical Algebra and Derived Categories
2022-05, a student project in Shandong University

This notes is about homotopy theory of topological spaces and the localization of categories. We develop such a homotopy theory using techniques similar to simplicial sets. As for localization, we introducetwo methods to construct the localization category. One is the model category developed first by Quillen and the other is the calculus of fractions which is in fact earlier than model categories. And we mainly focus on the example of chain complexes.

### Galois Theory
2022-01, Lecture notes of the course given by [Prof. Yongquan Hu](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/faculty/huyongquan/201509/t20150909_306981.html)

The course is mainly about Galois theory and topics covered contain finite Galois extensions, compass and straightedge construction, solvability of algebraic equations, infinite Galois theory, Galois cohomology, Kummer theory and so on. During the course, I helped Prof. Hu type the lecture notes. [Download notes here](https://yining2001.github.io/file/2022-01-notes-1.pdf)
