## Higher Stacks and Derived Critical Loci
It's my Bachelor's thesis supervised by [Prof. Joost](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~jnuiten/) in Toulouse. It consists of three parts. In the first part we give a concise introduction to ToÃ«n and Vezzosi's work on homotopical algebraic geometry, a particular example of which is the derived algebraic geometry. Our main objects to study in this part are simplicial presheaves and we will show higher stacks are simplicial presheaves satisfying the descent for hypercovers. From this we can also obtain the concept of derived stacks. In the second part we focus on derived critical loci which is actually a derived intersection. We will show this construction is dual to BV-formalization in mathematical physics and serves a model for -1-shifted symplectic structure. Finally there is an appendix about homotopical algebra necessary for reading this thesis especially the first part. In this appendix we will talk about abstract homotopy theory in detail especially homotopy (co)limits and simplicial model categories.
