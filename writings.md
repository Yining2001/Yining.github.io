## Thesis
### Higher Stacks and Derived Critical Loci
2023-05, Toulouse, Bachelor's thesis

It's my Bachelor's thesis supervised by [Prof. Joost](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~jnuiten/) in Toulouse which consists of three parts. In the first part we give a concise introduction to ToÃ«n and Vezzosi's work on homotopical algebraic geometry, a particular example of which is the derived algebraic geometry. Our main objects to study in this part are simplicial presheaves and we will show higher stacks are simplicial presheaves satisfying the descent for hypercovers. From this we can also obtain the concept of derived stacks. In the second part we focus on derived critical loci which are actually a derived intersection. We will show this construction is dual to BV-formalization in mathematical physics and serves a model for -1-shifted symplectic structure. Finally there is an appendix about homotopical algebra necessary for reading this thesis especially the first part. In this appendix we will talk about abstract homotopy theory in detail especially homotopy (co)limits and simplicial model categories.

## Notes

### Topics in Deformation Theory
2022-06

It's an article about deformation theory where we talk about the deformation theory for Hilbert schemes, formal geometry, cotangent complexes and differential graded Lie algebras (dgLa). But note that it's written in Chinese! [Download notes here](https://yining2001.github.io/file/2022-06-notes-1.pdf)

### The Geometry of Triangles
2022-05

In this article we make the concept of a continuous family of triangles precise and prove the moduli functor classifying oriented triangles admits a fine moduli space but the functor classifying non-oriented triangles only admits a coarse moduli space. We hope moduli spaces of triangles can help understand stacks. [Download notes here](https://yining2001.github.io/file/2022-05-notes-2.pdf)

### Homotopical Algebra and Derived Categories
2022-05, a student project in Shandong University

This notes is about homotopy theory of topological spaces and the localization of categories. We develop such a homotopy theory using techniques similar to simplicial sets. As for localization, we introduce two methods to construct the localization category. One is the model category developed first by Quillen and the other is the calculus of fractions which is in fact earlier than model categories. And we mainly focus on the example of chain complexes.

### Galois Theory
2022-01, Lecture notes of the course given by [Prof. Yongquan Hu](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/faculty/huyongquan/201509/t20150909_306981.html)

The course is mainly about Galois theory and topics covered contain finite Galois extensions, compass and straightedge construction, solvability of algebraic equations, infinite Galois theory, Galois cohomology, Kummer theory and so on. During the course, I helped Prof. Hu type the lecture notes. [Download notes here](https://yining2001.github.io/file/2022-01-notes-1.pdf)

### A Short Intrduction to Representable Functors
2021-04, a presentation in the course of elementary algebraic geometry

We give a short introduction to representable functors which originate in the problem how to make the category of varieties with regular maps unique. When embedded into a bigger category, the only possible way to make varieties form a category is to choose regular maps. This bigger category is the category of presheaves.
